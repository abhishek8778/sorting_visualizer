# Sorting-Visualizer
The concept of visualizing algorithms lets us understand algorithms in a much better way.

This project is built using ReactJS. 
It includes visualization of few classic sorting algorithms such as: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort.


PLAY AROUND WITH IT AND HAVE FUN! :)
